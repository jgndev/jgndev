# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak

Building Software that solves a problem is my dream job.


## 👨‍🚀 About:

I love to learn something new and use my skills to build cool things. As a Maker personality type, I am happiest when building and improving things that solve a problem or do something useful. Today I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and have created several projects that I invite you to explore and ask me questions if you have them.

I'm always adding new skills, techniques, and best practices to my toolkit. Please reach out if you would like to connect.

Away from keyboard I am a 🐴 horseman 🏇, and enjoy being outdoors with my family and animals.
