# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak

I love to learn something new and use my skills to build cool things. As a Maker personality type, I am naturally interested in solving problems and craftsmanship of all kinds. 

I'm always adding new skills, techniques, and best practices to my toolkit. Please reach out if you would like to connect.
