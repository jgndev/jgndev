# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak


## 👨‍🚀 About:

Building Software that solves a problem is my dream job.

I love to learn something new and use my skills to build cool things. As a Maker personality type, I am happiest when building and improving things that solve a problem or do something useful. I'm currently focused on Data Structures and Algothrims, .NET deep dive and picking up some UI/UX.  

My hot take for 2023 is that WASM, AI and AR/VR are the things to be learning. 🚀

I'm always adding new skills, techniques, and best practices to my toolkit. Please reach out if you would like to connect.

C#, ASP.NET Web API, TypeScript, React.js

Away from keyboard I am a 🐴 horseman 🏇, amateur :meat_on_bone: BBQ :fried_shrimp: cook, and enjoy being outdoors with my family and animals.
