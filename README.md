# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak


## 👨‍🚀 About:

I love to learn something new and use my skills to build cool things. As a Maker personality type, I am naturally motivated by building things and solving interesting problems.

I'm always adding new skills, techniques, and best practices to my toolkit. Please reach out if you would like to connect.

Away from keyboard I am a 🐴 horseman 🏇, and enjoy being outdoors with my family and animals.
