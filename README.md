# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak

Building Software that solves a problem is my dream job.


## 👨‍🚀 About:

I love to learn something new and use my skills to build cool things. As a Maker personality type, I am happiest when building and improving things that solve a problem or do something useful. Today I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and have created several projects that I invite you to explore and ask me questions if you have them. These projects demonstrate the type of skills that I have and the quality of work I will bring to your project.

In addition to my skills, I abide by three core tenants that I bring to any company, contract or freelance opportunity.

Work Ethic: Productivity is essential to me, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow to accomplish more. A good day is a very productive day.

Empathy: I endeavor to understand the needs of the business and put myself in the stakeholders' shoes. Then I leverage my skills as an engineer to produce the best solution for the project.

Love of the Craft: I'm committed to learning the best techniques and practices and improving my skillset to bring the most value to every project.

Away from keyboard I am a 🐴 horseman 🏇, and enjoy being outdoors with my family and animals.
