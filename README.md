# 👋 Howdy there, I'm Jeremy Novak


## 👨‍🚀 About:

Building Software that solves interesting problems is my dream job.

I love to learn something new and to build cool things. I'm currently focused on Data Structures and Algothrims, .NET, and exploring Design & UI/UX.  

My 🔥 hot take 🔥 for 2023 is that either WASM, or AR/VR are the things to be learning 🚀

I'm always adding new skills, techniques, and best practices to my toolkit. Please reach out if you would like to connect.

C#, ASP.NET Web API, Blazor WASM, TypeScript, React.js

Away from keyboard I am a 🐴 horseman 🏇, and enjoy being outdoors with my family and animals.
